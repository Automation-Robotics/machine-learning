 Task A:

__Supervised Machine Learning Task__ (CareerCon 2019: ‘Helping Robots to Navigate’ Dataset)

 This dataset is publicly available on Kaggle’s website https://www.kaggle.com/c/career-con-2019. CareerCon collected sensor data while driving a small mobile robot over different floor surfaces on university premises.



__Objective__


The task is to predict to your robot which of the nine types of floor surface it is approaching, such as carpet, tiles or concrete.

This will help your robot navigate without assistance across many different surfaces, without falling down.


__Your Task__

You are required to implement at least three classification algorithms and to follow the following steps.

 
Prepare the data and the model(s). This could include the following considerations:
cross-validation: splitting your data into a training dataset and a validation dataset.
feature-selection techniques: choose the best features for your models. You may need to use techniques such as PCA (to reduce dimensionality) or feature engineering (to combine multiple features).

good parameters for your model: techniques such as validation curves, random searches and/or grid searches will often help you to choose the best parameters.
avoidance of underfitting and overfitting: the bias and variation trade-off. In practice, the learning curve is a good tool that can be used to find out how much you benefit from adding more training data and whether the model suffers more from a variance error or a bias error. 
 

Once you have prepared each model, you need to train it. You are required to use at least three machine learning models. (4 marks)
Finally, you need to compare the results among the models. (2 marks)



 

## Task B:

__Unsupervised machine learning task__ (customer segmentation dataset / e-commerce data from the actual transactions of a UK retailer). This is a publicly available dataset on the Kaggle website https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data. It contains all the transactions during an eight-month period (1st December 2010 – 9th December 2011) for a UK-based online retail company. You need to use at least two algorithms to cluster this dataset.

 

## Task C: 

__Regression problem Task__

Finally, you are required to implement regression model to predict the cost insurance costs giving the age of primary beneficiary, an insurance contractor gender, the bmi: , the number of children covered by health insurance, smoking and the region.
